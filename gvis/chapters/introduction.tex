\chapter{Introduction}
The graph visualization user interface of DNA - Dynamic Network Analyzer offers an intuitive and easy to use graph visualization tool with elaborate customization options. Figure \ref{ex:attack} illustrates a sophisticated visualization of a graph modeling network activity. The following chapters will describe how to use gvis and how one may adapt it to specific cases.
