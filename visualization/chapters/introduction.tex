\chapter{Introduction}
The graphical user interface of the DNA – Dynamic Network Analyzer allows to illustrate and compare data of dynamic networks. It is equipped with numerous features, whose functioning and use will be described during this manual. The interface might be executed in two different operation modes, which will be briefly explained in the following.

\section{Playback-Mode}
The Playback-Mode is used to illustrate previously generated data. Therefore the generation process has to be completed prior to the playback start. During this mode the interface offers additional functionality like setting the playback speed or the „timeslider“, which allows the user to move back and forth through the generated data.

\section{Live Display-Mode}
The intend of this mode is to watch over the status and changes of a live-system. It uses a watchservice, which will automatically hand over any new batches found on the specified filesystem-path.
