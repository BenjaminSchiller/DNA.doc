\chapter{Introduction}
The DNA â€“ Dynamic Network Analyzer is a framework for graph-theoretic Analysis of Dynamic Networks. It offers sophisticated ways to generate and analyze graphs. The built-in Plotting- and LaTeX-output features allow to visualize and compare data by generating LaTeX-documents containing data and plots.

This manual will show how DNA can be used to generate and analyze graphs. It covers the most important aspects of graph generation using DNA including what options and parameters may be utilized in order to customize the outcome and reach certain results. Examples are going to be shown to give the user an insight on the impact of certain customizations.
